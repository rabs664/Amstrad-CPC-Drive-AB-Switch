# Amstrad-CPC-Drive-AB-Switch
 
Some Amstrad CPC software will not run on an external drive, Drive B, as it expects to run on the internal drive, Drive A.

This can be rectfied by adding a header to the floppy ribbon cable and inserting a small switch to pull Drive Select 1 (pin 23) low on the Disc Drive 2 Socket.
